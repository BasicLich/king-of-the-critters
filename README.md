# King of the Critters

See the game on [Itch.io](https://sundowns.itch.io/king-of-the-critters)

[Mizzjam1 submission](https://itch.io/jam/miz-jam-1/entries)

A quirky top-down puzzler about manipulating critters to do your bidding.
As with all Mizzjam entries, created with [Kenney's 1-bit art pack](https://kenney.nl/assets/bit-pack)

First Game Jam using Godot so lots of learning along the way.
